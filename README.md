# Digital Bank - Microservices Architecture

This document outlines the architecture and technical stack for the Digital Bank project. It is a microservice-based application with a React front-end, Java Spring Boot backend services, Kafka for asynchronous communication, PostgreSQL for data persistence, Redis for caching, and containerized using Docker and Kubernetes with Kustomize for deployment.

## 1. Overview

The Digital Bank platform is designed as a collection of independent, loosely coupled microservices. This architectural style promotes scalability, flexibility, and independent deployment of services. Each service is responsible for a specific business capability, such as customer accounts, transactions, or user authentication. [38, 39]

The front end is a single-page application (SPA) built with React, which interacts with the backend microservices via a dedicated API Gateway. Asynchronous communication and event-driven workflows between microservices are handled by Apache Kafka.

## 2. Architecture Diagram

**Key Components:**

*   **Frontend (React):** The user interface of the digital bank.
*   **API Gateway:** A single entry point for all client requests, routing them to the appropriate microservice. [4]
*   **Microservices (Java Spring Boot):** A collection of services, each handling a specific business domain (e.g., Account Service, Transaction Service, User Service). [4, 8]
*   **Message Broker (Apache Kafka):** Facilitates asynchronous communication and event streaming between microservices. [2, 3, 12]
*   **Database (PostgreSQL):** Each microservice has its own dedicated database to ensure loose coupling. [1, 14, 25]
*   **In-Memory Cache (Redis):** Used for caching frequently accessed data to improve performance. [7, 20, 27]
*   **Containerization (Docker):** All microservices are packaged as Docker containers. [10, 32]
*   **Orchestration (Kubernetes with Kustomize):** Manages the deployment, scaling, and networking of the containerized services. [32, 34, 35]
*   **CI/CD Pipeline:** Automates the build, testing, and deployment of the microservices. [5, 6, 17]

## 3. Services

This section provides a brief description of the primary microservices within the Digital Bank.

### 3.1. User Service

*   **Description:** Manages user registration, login, profile information, and authentication.
*   **Tech Stack:** Java Spring Boot, PostgreSQL
*   **API Endpoints:**
    *   `POST /api/users/register`
    *   `POST /api/users/login`
    *   `GET /api/users/{userId}`

### 3.2. Account Service

*   **Description:** Handles the creation and management of customer bank accounts, including balance inquiries and statements.
*   **Tech Stack:** Java Spring Boot, PostgreSQL, Redis (for caching account balances)
*   **API Endpoints:**
    *   `POST /api/accounts`
    *   `GET /api/accounts/{accountId}`
    *   `GET /api/accounts/user/{userId}`
*   **Kafka Topics:**
    *   `account-created`: Publishes an event when a new account is created.

### 3.3. Transaction Service

*   **Description:** Manages financial transactions, including deposits, withdrawals, and transfers between accounts.
*   **Tech Stack:** Java Spring Boot, PostgreSQL
*   **API Endpoints:**
    *   `POST /api/transactions/deposit`
    *   `POST /api/transactions/withdraw`
    *   `POST /api/transactions/transfer`
*   **Kafka Topics:**
    *   `transaction-completed`: Publishes an event upon successful completion of a transaction.

### 3.4. Notification Service

*   **Description:** Responsible for sending notifications to users (e.g., email, SMS) based on events in the system.
*   **Tech Stack:** Java Spring Boot
*   **Kafka Topics:**
    *   Subscribes to `account-created` and `transaction-completed` to send relevant notifications.

## 4. Technology Stack

### 4.1. Backend

*   **Framework:** Java Spring Boot [4, 8]
*   **Language:** Java
*   **Build Tool:** Maven or Gradle

### 4.2. Frontend

*   **Library:** React [21, 22, 26]
*   **State Management:** Redux (or a similar state management library) [24]
*   **Package Manager:** npm or yarn

### 4.3. Data Storage

*   **Database:** PostgreSQL [1, 14, 15]
    *   Each microservice will have its own schema or, preferably, its own database instance to maintain loose coupling. [1, 11]
*   **In-Memory Cache:** Redis [7, 23, 29]
    *   Used to cache frequently accessed data to reduce latency.

### 4.4. Messaging

*   **Message Broker:** Apache Kafka [2, 3, 9]
    *   Used for asynchronous, event-driven communication between microservices. This enhances scalability and resilience. [2]

### 4.5. Containerization & Orchestration

*   **Containerization:** Docker [10, 32]
    *   Each microservice is packaged into a Docker image.
*   **Orchestration:** Kubernetes [32]
    *   Manages the deployment, scaling, and operation of the containerized applications.
*   **Configuration Management:** Kustomize [33, 34, 35]
    *   Used to customize Kubernetes resource configurations for different environments without forking YAML files.

## 5. CI/CD Pipeline

A robust CI/CD pipeline is essential for achieving the agility promised by microservices. [5, 6]

*   **Continuous Integration (CI):**
    *   Triggered on every code push to the main branch.
    *   Steps include: code checkout, unit testing, integration testing, code analysis, and building a Docker image. [16]
*   **Continuous Deployment (CD):**
    *   Triggered after a successful CI build.
    *   The Docker image is pushed to a container registry.
    *   Kustomize is used to apply the updated configurations to the respective Kubernetes environment (e.g., development, staging, production). [16, 36]
    *   Automated deployment strategies like blue-green or canary deployments can be implemented to minimize downtime and risk. [6]

**Pipeline Tools (Example):**

*   Jenkins, GitLab CI, or GitHub Actions

## 6. Local Development Setup

To set up the development environment locally, you will need:

*   Java (version specified in `pom.xml` or `build.gradle`)
*   Node.js and npm/yarn
*   Docker and Docker Compose
*   `kubectl` and a local Kubernetes cluster (e.g., Minikube, Kind)

A `docker-compose.yml` file is provided in the root of the repository to spin up the necessary infrastructure components (PostgreSQL, Kafka, Redis).

## 7. Configuration Management

Application configuration for each microservice is managed through `application.yml` (or `application.properties`) files. For Kubernetes deployments, configurations are externalized using ConfigMaps and Secrets, which are then applied using Kustomize overlays for different environments.

## 8. API Documentation

API documentation for each microservice is generated using Swagger/OpenAPI. The API documentation can be accessed at the `/swagger-ui.html` endpoint of each respective service.```
